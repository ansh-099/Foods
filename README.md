Reached the resturant? Now want to have some food? Just fed up with long lines on counter while odering food? </br>

Now releasing a new way to get food billing, just with few clicks. No need to go to the counter in the restaurant. This service is for both have it and take away.


## Idea

Our application aims to digitalise the process of various restaurant operations including ordering, billing, hall and inventory management.

The main purpose is to improve the performance of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently.An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual.The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant.

## Working and Implementation

* Reach the restaurant.
* Get seated on a table.
* On each table there is a QR code you can scan that through the app and resturant menu will pop up.
* Now you can order.
* Finally pay through payment gateway.
* Now 🍕 have it.
* How is the food? 😋

Food items get updated each time when available in realtime.
