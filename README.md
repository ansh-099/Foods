## Idea

The main purpose is to improve the performance of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently.An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual.The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant.

## Implementation

* Get seated on a table.
* On each table there is a QR code you can scan that through the app and resturant menu will pop up.
* Now you can order.
* Finally pay through payment gateway.
* Now üçï have it.
* How is the food? üòã

Food items get updated each time when available in realtime.
